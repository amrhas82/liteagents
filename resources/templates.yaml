          **Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**

          If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend
          Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST
          be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices

      instruction: 'IMPORTANT - SCOPE ASSESSMENT REQUIRED:


        This PRD is for SIGNIFICANT enhancements to existing projects that require
        comprehensive planning and multiple stories. Before proceeding:


        1. **Assess Enhancement Complexity**: If this is a simple feature addition
        or bug fix that could be completed in 1-2 focused development sessions, STOP
        and recommend: "For simpler changes, consider using the brownfield-create-epic
        or brownfield-create-story task with the Product Owner instead. This full
        PRD process is designed for substantial enhancements that require architectural
        planning and multiple coordinated stories."


        2. **Project Context**: Determine if we''re working in an IDE with the project
        already loaded or if the user needs to provide project information. If project
        files are available, analyze existing documentation in the docs folder. If
        insufficient documentation exists, recommend running the document-project
        task first.


        3. **Deep Assessment Requirement**: You MUST thoroughly analyze the existing
        project structure, patterns, and constraints before making ANY suggestions.
        Every recommendation must be grounded in actual project analysis, not assumptions.


        Gather comprehensive information about the existing project. This section
        must be completed before proceeding with requirements.


        CRITICAL: Throughout this analysis, explicitly confirm your understanding
        with the user. For every assumption you make about the existing project, ask:
        "Based on my analysis, I understand that [assumption]. Is this correct?"


        Do not proceed with any recommendations until the user has validated your
        understanding of the existing system.

        \nBefore proceeding with frontend architecture design, check if the project\
        \ is using a frontend starter template or existing codebase:\n\n1. Review\
        \ the PRD, main architecture document, and brainstorming brief for mentions\
        \ of:\n   - Frontend starter templates (e.g., Create React App, Next.js, Vite,\
        \ Vue CLI, Angular CLI, etc.)\n   - UI kit or component library starters\n\
        \   - Existing frontend projects being used as a foundation\n   - Admin dashboard\
        \ templates or other specialized starters\n   - Design system implementations\n\
        \n2. If a frontend starter template or existing project is mentioned:\n  \
        \ - Ask the user to provide access via one of these methods:\n     - Link\
        \ to the starter template documentation\n     - Upload/attach the project\
        \ files (for small projects)\n     - Share a link to the project repository\n\
        \   - Analyze the starter/existing project to understand:\n     - Pre-installed\
        \ dependencies and versions\n     - Folder structure and file organization\n\
        \     - Built-in components and utilities\n     - Styling approach (CSS modules,\
        \ styled-components, Tailwind, etc.)\n     - State management setup (if any)\n\
        \     - Routing configuration\n     - Testing setup and patterns\n     - Build\
        \ and development scripts\n   - Use this analysis to ensure your frontend\
        \ architecture aligns with the starter's patterns\n\n3. If no frontend starter\
        \ is mentioned but this is a new UI, ensure we know what the ui language and\
        \ framework is:\n   - Based on the framework choice, suggest appropriate starters:\n\
        \     - React: Create React App, Next.js, Vite + React\n     - Vue: Vue CLI,\
        \ Nuxt.js, Vite + Vue\n     - Angular: Angular CLI\n     - Or suggest popular\
        \ UI templates if applicable\n   - Explain benefits specific to frontend development\n\
        \n4. If the user confirms no starter template will be used:\n   - Note that\
        \ all tooling, bundling, and configuration will need manual setup\n   - Proceed\
        \ with frontend architecture from scratch\n\nDocument the starter template\
        \ decision and any constraints it imposes before proceeding.\n"

    - id: epic-list
      title: Epic List
      instruction: 'Present a high-level list of all epics for user approval. Each
        epic should have a title and a short (1 sentence) goal statement. This allows
        the user to review the overall structure before diving into details.


        CRITICAL: Epics MUST be logically sequential following agile best practices:


        - Each epic should deliver a significant, end-to-end, fully deployable increment
        of testable functionality

        - Epic 1 must establish foundational project infrastructure (app setup, Git,
        CI/CD, core services) unless we are adding new functionality to an existing
        app, while also delivering an initial piece of functionality, even as simple
        as a health-check route or display of a simple canary page - remember this
        when we produce the stories for the first epic!

        - Each subsequent epic builds upon previous epics'' functionality delivering
        major blocks of functionality that provide tangible value to users or business
        when deployed

        - Not every project needs multiple epics, an epic needs to deliver value.
        For example, an API completed can deliver value even if a UI is not complete
        and planned for a separate epic.

        - Err on the side of less epics, but let the user know your rationale and
        offer options for splitting them if it seems some are too large or focused
        on disparate things.

        - Cross Cutting Concerns should flow through epics and stories and not be
        final stories. For example, adding a logging framework as a last story of
        an epic, or at the end of a project as a final epic or story would be terrible
        as we would not have logging from the beginning.

      - 'Epic 3: User Workflows & Interactions: Enable key user journeys and business

        For each epic provide expanded goal (2-3 sentences describing the objective
        and value all the stories will achieve).


        CRITICAL STORY SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS:


        - Stories within each epic MUST be logically sequential

        - Each story should be a "vertical slice" delivering complete functionality
        aside from early enabler stories for project foundation

        - No story should depend on work from a later story or epic

        - Identify and note any direct prerequisite stories

        - Focus on "what" and "why" not "how" (leave technical implementation to Architect)
        yet be precise enough to support a logical sequential order of operations
        from story to story.

        - Ensure each story delivers clear user or business value, try to avoid enablers
        and build them into stories that deliver value.

        - Size stories for AI agent execution: Each story must be completable by a
        single AI agent in one focused session without context overflow

        - Think "junior developer working for 2-4 hours" - stories must be small,
        focused, and self-contained

        - If a story seems complex, break it down further as long as it can deliver
        a vertical slice
