## Variant Philosophy

The agentic-kit installer offers **three variant levels** to accommodate different user needs and resource constraints:

### Design Principles

1. **Progressive Capability:** Each variant builds upon the previous, adding functionality without removing features
2. **Clear Use Cases:** Each variant targets specific user personas and workflows
3. **Resource Optimization:** Variants minimize disk space and cognitive load while maximizing value
4. **Consistent Core:** All tools share the same variant structure for predictability

### Variant Tiers

| Variant | Agents | Skills | Target Users | Disk Space |
|---------|--------|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Lite** | 3 core | 0 | Beginners, evaluators, minimal setup | ~5-10 MB |
| **Standard** | All (13) | 8 core | Professional developers, teams | ~50-100 MB |
| **Pro** | All (13) | All (22) | Power users, enterprises | ~150-200 MB |

- May add new "core" skills if universally useful
- Will maintain ~8-12 skills to balance capability vs. bloat

**Pro Variant Philosophy:**
- Will include all available skills (no limit)
- New experimental skills added here first
- Power users get early access to new capabilities

## Customization

### Custom Variants

Advanced users can create custom `variants.json` configurations:

```json
{
  "custom": {
    "name": "Custom",
    "description": "My custom variant",
    "useCase": "Specific to my workflow",
    "targetUsers": "Me",
    "agents": ["master", "orchestrator", "full-stack-dev"],
    "skills": ["pdf", "docx", "code-review", "webapp-testing"],
    "resources": "*",
    "hooks": "*"
  }
}
```

Then install with:
```bash
node installer/cli.js --variant custom
```

### Skill-Specific Installation

While not officially supported, you can manually add specific skills:

1. Install desired variant
2. Manually copy skill directories from another installation
3. Update `manifest.json` to include new skills
