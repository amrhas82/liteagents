### Ultra-Lean Architecture Benefits

- **Modular Design** - Each agent and skill is independent
- **Auto-Discovery** - Agents auto-register via hooks
- **No Runtime Dependencies** - Works without external services
- **Fast Loading** - Minimal startup overhead
- **Easy Extension** - Add custom agents and skills easily

### How Agents Are Registered

1. **Hook Trigger** - Plugin loads `hooks/register-agents.js`
2. **Directory Scan** - Hook scans `agents/` directory
3. **Metadata Extraction** - Parses agent markdown files
4. **Context Registration** - Registers in Claude's context
5. **Auto-Invocation** - Agents appear with @ mention

### How Skills Are Loaded

1. **Manifest Declaration** - Variant manifest lists skills
2. **Path Resolution** - Resolves skill directory paths
3. **Runtime Access** - Skills available to agents
4. **Dynamic Loading** - Load on demand when invoked

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical deep dive.

## Troubleshooting

### Agents Not Appearing in Auto-Invocation

**Problem:** Can't find agents with @ mention

**Solutions:**
1. Verify installation: `@Master: *help`
2. Refresh Claude (F5)
3. Check variant manifest includes your agent
4. See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

### Skills Not Loading

**Problem:** Skill commands don't work

**Solutions:**
1. Verify your variant includes the skill
2. Check skill path in manifest
3. Ensure skill files are present
4. See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

### Reference or Path Issues

**Problem:** Agents reference missing files

**Solutions:**
1. Run validation script: `./validate-references.sh`
2. Reinstall toolkit
3. Report issue with output from validation

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for comprehensive troubleshooting guide.
