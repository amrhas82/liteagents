## What You Need to Do

1. **Open:** [PRD-AGENTIC-KIT-FINAL.md](PRD-AGENTIC-KIT-FINAL.md)
2. **Read:** Entire document (especially Section 7: Internal Reference Updates)
3. **Review:** The 4 key decisions:
   - ✅ 3 variants (lite/standard/pro)?
   - ✅ 4-directory architecture?
   - ✅ 145-280 internal references must be updated?
   - ✅ 18-26 hour timeline realistic?
4. **Approve:** Or request changes
5. **Confirm:** Ready to proceed with Phase 1

## Quick Summary of What You Approved

**Your Decisions:**
- Distribution: Claude Code Marketplace (primary) + npm (secondary)
- Target: Non-technical domain experts (product, design, business)
- Variants: Lite (3 agents), Standard (all agents + 8 skills), Pro (all agents + all skills)
- Architecture: Ultra-Lean A (4 directories)
- Tasks: Convert 22 tasks → consolidated into resources/task-briefs.md

**The Critical Detail You Emphasized:**
- All internal references must be updated (145-280 instances)
- Path changes: `../templates/file.yaml` → `../resources/templates.yaml#anchor-name`
- File names must be standardized (hyphens, underscores, matching anchors)
- This is why implementation takes 18-26 hours (not 10-14)
