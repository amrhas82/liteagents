# Development Workflow

## Daily Dev Loop

### 1. Pick Task
- Check `02-features/*/dev-tasks.md` or backlog
- Verify acceptance criteria clear

### 2. Implement
- Write test first (if TDD)
- Implement feature
- Run tests locally
- Update docs

### 3. Review
- Self-review checklist:
  - [ ] Tests pass
  - [ ] Docs updated
  - [ ] No console.logs/debugs
  - [ ] Security reviewed
- Create PR

### 4. Ship
- Merge after approval
- Update `03-logs/implementation-log.md`
- Monitor production

## Branch Strategy
- `main`: production-ready code
- `feature/*`: new features
- `fix/*`: bug fixes

## Working with LLMs
- Provide context: link to relevant docs
- Reference acceptance criteria from feature specs
- Ask to update logs after changes
- Request test generation

## Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Matches acceptance criteria
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases
- [ ] Docs updated
- [ ] No security issues
- [ ] Performance acceptable
```

# Documentation Guide

## Structure

Our docs follow a 5-tier hierarchy:

- **00-context/**: WHY this exists, WHAT's currently built
- **01-product/**: WHAT we must build (requirements)
- **02-features/**: HOW features are designed and built
- **03-logs/**: MEMORY of changes, decisions, bugs over time
- **04-process/**: HOW to work (workflows, standards)

## Quick Navigation

**Start here**: `00-context/vision.md` - understand product purpose
**Requirements**: `01-product/prd.md` - single source of truth
**Feature work**: `02-features/feature-*/` - specs, designs, tasks
**History**: `03-logs/` - what changed and why
**Workflows**: `04-process/` - how we work daily

## For Developers

1. **Starting new feature**:
   - Read: `01-product/prd.md` for requirements
   - Check: `02-features/` for existing feature patterns
   - Create: `02-features/feature-<name>/` with 4 files

2. **Daily work**:
   - Follow: `04-process/dev-workflow.md`
   - Check: `04-process/definition-of-done.md` before PR

3. **After changes**:
   - Update: `03-logs/implementation-log.md`
   - Update: `03-logs/decisions-log.md` if architectural

## For LLMs

Standard prompts: `04-process/llm-prompts.md`
Context loading: Start with `00-context/`, then drill into specific features

## Legacy Docs

[If existing docs/ subdirs exist, map them here]
- Old `commands/` → See `02-features/cli/`
- Old `development/` → See `04-process/dev-workflow.md`
- Old `guides/` → Distributed across `02-features/`
- Old `reference/` → See `00-context/` and `01-product/`
