# Global Opencode CLI

Opencode is a lightweight CLI tool that provides workflow automation commands.

## Opencode Subagents (Reference)

These subagents are available when using Claude Code CLI. Opencode can reference them but doesn't implement them directly.

### Subagents (14 total)

| 1-create-prd | 1-Create PRD | Define Scope - use to clearly outline what needs to be built with a Product Requirement Document (PRD) |
| 2-generate-tasks | 2-Generate Tasks | Detailed Planning - use to break down the PRD into a granular, actionable task list |
| 3-process-task-list | 3-Process Task List | Iterative Implementation - use to guide the AI to tackle one task at a time, allowing you to review and approve each change |
