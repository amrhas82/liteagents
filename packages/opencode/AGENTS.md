# Global Opencode Agents

This file provides guidance and memory for your coding CLI.

# MANDATORY: Orchestrator-First Routing Pattern

**System Instruction for Opencode**:
When processing ANY user request, invoke the `orchestrator` agent FIRST unless:
- User explicitly mentions a specific agent: `@agent-id` or `As agent-id, ...`
- User invokes a command: `/command-name`
- User gives a direct command: `npm test`, `git status`, file operations, etc.

**Why orchestrator first?**
- Analyzes user intent and matches to optimal workflow
- Asks clarifying questions for conditional workflow steps (e.g., "Research first?")
- Coordinates multi-agent sequences with minimal context passing
- Ensures systematic approach to complex tasks

**Orchestrator reads this registry** to match requests to specialists and invoke via Task tool with selective context injection.

# Opencode subagents and Commands (OpenCode)

Opencode reads AGENTS.md during initialization and uses it as part of its system prompt for the session. 

## How To Use With Opencode

Activate agents by mentioning their ID in your prompts:
- `"@quality-assurance review this code"`
- Copy/paste `opencode` subfolders in this project to ~/.config/opencode and Opencode will read and access agents from ~/.config/opencode/agent and tasks from ~~/.config/opencode/resources/tasks-brief.md,
- You can access agents using "@ui-designer", or you can reference a role naturally, e.g., "As ui-designer, implement ..." or use commands defined in your tasks.

Note
- Orchestrators/master run as mode: primary; other agents as mode: subagents.
- All agents have enbaled tools: write, edit, bash.

## Common Workflow Patterns

The orchestrator uses these patterns to match user intent to multi-agent workflows. Each step is **conditional** - orchestrator asks user approval before advancing.

### 1. Feature Discovery Flow (Most Common)
**User Intent**: "I need to add [feature]", "Build [new functionality]"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator analyzes → asks: "Research competitive approaches first?"
  ├─ Yes → market-researcher (research) → ask: "Create formal PRD?"
  │   ├─ Yes → 1-create-prd → ask: "Generate implementation tasks?"
  │   │   ├─ Yes → 2-generate-tasks → ask: "Start systematic implementation?"
  │   │   │   ├─ Yes → 3-process-task-list
  │   │   │   └─ No → Done (user has task list for review)
  │   │   └─ No → Done (user has PRD for review)
  │   └─ No → Done (user has research for review)
  └─ No → 1-create-prd → (same conditional tree from PRD onward)
```

### 2. Product Definition Flow
**User Intent**: "We're considering a new product/initiative", "Strategic product planning"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → ask: "Follow product definition workflow?"
└─ Yes → feature-planner (strategy, vision) → ask: "Define user stories?"
    └─ Yes → backlog-manager (backlog, stories) → ask: "Technical feasibility assessment?"
        └─ Yes → system-architect (platform decisions, technical design)
```

### 3. Story Implementation Flow
**User Intent**: "Implement [existing story]", "Build [defined feature with acceptance criteria]"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → ask: "Validate story readiness first?"
├─ Yes → backlog-manager (validate acceptance criteria) → code-developer → quality-assurance
└─ No → code-developer (implement) → quality-assurance (quality gate)
```

### 4. Architecture Decision Flow
**User Intent**: "Should we use [tech A] or [tech B]?", "How should we architect [system]?"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → market-researcher (gather constraints, requirements)
            → system-architect (options analysis, tradeoffs)
            → ask: "Need product alignment?"
            └─ Yes → feature-planner (strategic alignment, decision rationale)
```

### 5. UI Development Flow
**User Intent**: "Build [UI component]", "Design and implement [interface]"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → ui-designer (wireframes, design system)
            → ask: "Complex enough to need PRD?"
            ├─ Yes → 1-create-prd → code-developer → quality-assurance
            └─ No → code-developer (implement) → quality-assurance (validate)
```

### 6. Bug Triage Flow
**User Intent**: "Bug: [description]", "Fix [broken behavior]"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → code-developer (investigate root cause)
            → ask: "Severity level?"
            ├─ Critical → code-developer (immediate fix) → quality-assurance (verify)
            └─ Non-critical → 1-create-prd (bug story) → backlog (for sprint planning)
```

### 7. Brownfield Discovery Flow
**User Intent**: "Help me understand this codebase", "Document existing system"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → context-builder (build knowledge base, discover patterns)
            → market-researcher (document current state, stakeholders)
            → ask: "Assess technical debt and modernization opportunities?"
            └─ Yes → system-architect (technical assessment, recommendations)
```

### 8. Quality Validation Flow
**User Intent**: "Review this PR", "Check code quality before merge"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → quality-assurance (comprehensive review)
            → [Decision gate]
            ├─ PASS → Done (ready to merge)
            ├─ CONCERNS → Present issues → user decides next step
            └─ FAIL → code-developer (apply fixes) → quality-assurance (re-validate)
```

### 9. Sprint Planning Flow
**User Intent**: "Plan next sprint", "Prepare sprint backlog"
**Workflow**:
```
orchestrator → feature-planner (prioritize features for sprint)
            → story-writer (break into user stories)
            → backlog-manager (add acceptance criteria)
            → 2-generate-tasks (create sprint backlog with tasks)
```

### Selective Context Injection

When orchestrator invokes specialists, it passes **minimal necessary context**:

**✓ Include**:
- Direct user requirements for the specific task
- Outputs from immediate workflow dependencies only
- Relevant domain-specific files/data

**✗ Exclude**:
- Full conversation history
- Unrelated workflow step outputs
- Tangential project context

**Example**: When invoking `quality-assurance`:
- ✓ Include: code diff, test requirements, acceptance criteria
- ✗ Exclude: PRD creation discussions, UI wireframes, database schema decisions
