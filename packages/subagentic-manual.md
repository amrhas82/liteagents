# Subagentic Manual

Production-ready AI agent framework providing specialized subagents, workflow commands, and development skills for **Claude Code**, **OpenCode**, **Ampcode**, and **Droid**. Deploy expert AI personas instantly with zero configuration.

---

## Why Subagentic?

**The Challenge**: Generic AI assistants lack specialized expertise and systematic workflows, leading to inconsistent results and context overload.

**The Solution**: Subagentic provides:
- **Role-Specialized Agents** - Expert personas (architect, QA, product manager) with domain-specific knowledge
- **Systematic Workflows** - Proven development patterns (PRD → Tasks → Implementation)
- **Orchestrator-First Routing** - Automatic workflow matching based on user intent
- **Frontmatter-Based Discovery** - All resources self-describe via YAML frontmatter
- **Platform Agnostic** - Works across Claude Code, OpenCode, Ampcode, and Droid

**The Result**: Predictable, high-quality outputs from specialized agents following best practices, without manually switching contexts or crafting complex prompts.

## Quick Start

Clone the toolkit:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amrhas82/agentic-toolkit
cd agentic-toolkit/ai/subagentic
```

Install for your platform:

| Platform | Installation | What's Included |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Claude Code** | `cp -r claude/* ~/.claude/` | 11 subagents + 10 skills + 10 commands |
| **Droid** | `cp -r droid/* ~/.factory/` | 20 commands (subagent references) |
| **Ampcode** | `cp -r ampcode/* ~/.config/amp/` | 11 subagents + 10 skills + 10 commands |
| **OpenCode** | `cp -r opencode/* ~/.config/opencode/` | 20 commands (subagent references) |

**Key Difference**:
- **Claude Code / Ampcode** implement full subagent system with orchestrator
- **Droid/OpenCode** provide commands only + reference documentation for subagents

---

## What's Included

### Claude Code / Ampcode (Full System)

**11 Subagents** - Expert personas with specialized knowledge
- 3 Workflow Agents (PRD, Tasks, Implementation)
- 8 Specialist Agents (UX, QA, Architecture, Product, Development, etc.)

**10 Skills** - Auto-triggering workflow components
- test-driven-development, testing-anti-patterns, verification-before-completion (auto-trigger)
- brainstorming, code-review, systematic-debugging, docs-builder, etc.

**10 Commands** - Simple workflow helpers
- debug, explain, git-commit, optimize, refactor, review, security, ship, stash, test-generate

**Orchestration System**
- Automatic intent matching to 9 workflow patterns
- Conditional decision points with user approval gates

### Droid/OpenCode (Commands Only)

**20 Commands** - All workflow capabilities in command form
- Combines skills + commands into unified command set
- Same functionality, different invocation model (no auto-triggering)

## Subagents

### Workflow Agents (3)

| Agent | Purpose |

## Usage Patterns

### Claude Code / Ampcode: Orchestrator-First (Recommended)

The orchestrator analyzes your request and routes to optimal workflows automatically.

**How it works**:
1. Make natural requests: "Add login feature", "Review this PR", "Plan next sprint"
2. Orchestrator matches intent to workflow patterns
3. Conditional gates ask for approval before each phase
4. Specialists execute with domain expertise

**Example Flow - Feature Development**:
```
User: "Add authentication feature"
  ↓
Orchestrator: "Research competitive approaches first?" [Yes/No]
  ↓ Yes
Market Researcher: [Gathers auth patterns, OAuth vs JWT tradeoffs]
  ↓
Orchestrator: "Create formal PRD?" [Yes/No]
  ↓ Yes
1-Create-PRD: [Structured requirements document]
  ↓
Orchestrator: "Generate implementation tasks?" [Yes/No]
  ↓ Yes
2-Generate-Tasks: [20 granular tasks with acceptance criteria]
  ↓
Orchestrator: "Start systematic implementation?" [Yes/No]
  ↓ Yes
3-Process-Task-List: [Iterative implementation with review gates]
```

**Bypass Options**:
- Direct agent: `@quality-assurance review this code`
- Role syntax: `As system-architect, design the API layer`
- Skills: `/test-driven-development login-feature`

### 9 Pre-Defined Workflow Patterns

1. **Feature Discovery Flow** - Research → PRD → Tasks → Implementation
2. **Product Definition Flow** - Strategy → Epics/Stories → Technical Assessment
3. **Story Implementation Flow** - Validate → Implement → QA Gate
4. **Architecture Decision Flow** - Constraints → Analysis → Alignment
5. **UI Development Flow** - Design → PRD (optional) → Implement → Validate
6. **Bug Triage Flow** - Investigate → Severity Assessment → Fix/Backlog
7. **Brownfield Discovery Flow** - Context Building → Documentation → Assessment
8. **Quality Validation Flow** - Review → Pass/Concerns/Fail → Remediation
9. **Sprint Planning Flow** - Prioritize → Stories → Criteria → Tasks

Each pattern includes conditional decision points requiring user approval.

### Droid/OpenCode: Direct Command Invocation

No orchestrator - invoke commands directly:
- `/debug <issue>`
- `/refactor <code-section>`
- `/test-driven-development <feature>`

Subagent workflows require manual coordination.

## Frontmatter Architecture

All resources are self-describing via YAML frontmatter for auto-discovery:

**Subagents** (`agents/*.md`):
```yaml
---
id: code-developer
title: Full Stack Developer
description: Implement code, debug, refactor
when_to_use: Use for code implementation, debugging, refactoring, and development best practices
model: inherit
color: purple
---
```

**Skills** (`skills/*/SKILL.md`):
```yaml
---
id: test-driven-development
name: test-driven-development
description: Write test first, watch it fail, write minimal code to pass
usage: /test-driven-development <feature-or-behavior-to-test>
auto_trigger: true
---
```

**Commands** (`commands/*.md`):
```yaml
---
id: debug
name: debug
description: Debug an issue systematically using structured investigation techniques
usage: /debug <issue-description>
argument-hint: [description of the problem]
---
```

This enables:
- Dynamic registry building by CLIs
- Single source of truth (no manual registries)
- Consistent metadata across platforms
- Easy extensibility
