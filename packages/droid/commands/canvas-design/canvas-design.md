Create original visual designs through design philosophies expressed visually, not through text-heavy layouts.

## Two-Phase Process

### Phase 1: Design Philosophy Creation
Create a visual philosophy (4-6 paragraphs) that guides the aesthetic:

**Name the movement** (1-2 words): "Brutalist Joy" / "Chromatic Silence" / "Metabolist Dreams"

**Articulate the philosophy** expressing how it manifests through:
- Space and form
- Color and material
- Scale and rhythm
- Composition and balance
- Visual hierarchy

**Critical principles:**
- **Emphasize craftsmanship** - Work should appear meticulously crafted by a master
- **Minimal text** - Text as rare, powerful gesture, never explanatory blocks
- **Spatial expression** - Ideas communicate through form, color, composition
- **Artistic freedom** - Provide interpretive room for visual execution
- **Pure design** - Create art objects, not documents with decoration

### Phase 2: Canvas Creation
Express the philosophy visually using design tools, creating .png or .pdf outputs.

## Design Philosophy Examples

### "Concrete Poetry"
**Philosophy:** Communication through monumental form and bold geometry.
**Visual expression:** Massive color blocks, sculptural typography (huge single words, tiny labels), Brutalist spatial divisions. Ideas expressed through visual weight and spatial tension, not explanation. Text as rare, powerful gesture - never paragraphs, only essential words integrated into the visual architecture. Every element placed with the precision of a master craftsman.

### "Chromatic Language"  
**Philosophy:** Color as the primary information system.
**Visual expression:** Geometric precision where color zones create meaning. Typography minimal - small sans-serif labels letting chromatic fields communicate. Think Josef Albers' interaction meets data visualization. Information encoded spatially and chromatically. Words only to anchor what color already shows. The result of painstaking chromatic calibration.

### "Analog Meditation"
**Philosophy:** Quiet visual contemplation through texture and breathing room.
**Visual expression:** Paper grain, ink bleeds, vast negative space. Photography and illustration dominate. Typography whispered (small, restrained, serving the visual). Japanese photobook aesthetic. Images breathe across pages. Text appears sparingly - short phrases, never explanatory blocks. Each composition balanced with the care of a meditation practice.

### "Organic Systems"
**Philosophy:** Natural clustering and modular growth patterns.
**Visual expression:** Rounded forms, organic arrangements, color from nature through architecture. Information shown through visual diagrams, spatial relationships, iconography. Text only for key labels floating in space. The composition tells the story through expert spatial orchestration.

### "Geometric Silence"
**Philosophy:** Pure order and restraint.
**Visual expression:** Grid-based precision, bold photography or stark graphics, dramatic negative space. Typography precise but minimal - small essential text, large quiet zones. Swiss formalism meets Brutalist material honesty. Structure communicates, not words. Every alignment the work of countless refinements.

## Visual Design Principles

### Color Strategy
- **Palette selection** based on philosophy (warm/cool, high/low contrast)
- **Color relationships** (complementary, analogous, triadic)
- **Tone and mood** matching the conceptual intent
- **Minimal color** with maximum impact

### Typography Hierarchy
- **Scale relationships** (large headers, small captions)
- **Font pairing** (serif/sans-serif, weight contrasts)
- **Text as visual element** integrated into composition
- **Rare, essential text** - never explanatory paragraphs

### Spatial Composition
- **Balance and symmetry** or intentional asymmetry
- **Negative space** as active design element
- **Scale relationships** between elements
- **Visual flow** guiding viewer's eye

### Form and Shape
- **Geometric vs organic** forms matching philosophy
- **Repetition and pattern** creating rhythm
- **Contrast and harmony** in shapes
- **Structural elements** supporting composition

## Canvas Creation Techniques

### Layout Approaches
```python
# Grid-based layout
- Divide canvas into sections
- Use mathematical proportions (golden ratio, thirds)
- Create visual hierarchy through placement

# Organic layout  
- Flowing, curved compositions
- Natural clustering of elements
- Asymmetrical balance
```

### Visual Elements
- **Photography** with artistic treatment
- **Illustrations** (vector or raster)
- **Geometric shapes** and patterns
- **Texture and material** effects
- **Color fields** and gradients

### Text Integration
- **Essential labels** only
- **Visual typography** as design element
- **Scale contrast** (large impact words, small details)
- **Minimal copy** supporting visual message

## Quality Standards

### Design Execution
- **Professional finish** - no amateur elements
- **Consistent style** throughout composition
- **Technical precision** in alignment and proportions
- **Original concepts** avoiding clichés

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Clear focal points** - viewer knows where to look first
- **Supporting elements** in proper scale relationships
- **Flow and rhythm** through the composition
- **Coherent color scheme** reinforcing the concept

### Craftsmanship
- **Attention to detail** in every element
- **Refined execution** showing professional skill
- **Conceptual clarity** expressing the philosophy
- **Emotional impact** through visual choices

## Usage Examples

**Create poster art:**
`/canvas-design "jazz concert poster" "png"`

**Design magazine layout:**
`/canvas-design "architectural review spread" "pdf"`

**Generate brand visual:**
`/canvas-design "tech startup identity" "png"`

**Design book cover:**
`/canvas-design "literary fiction novel" "pdf"`

**Create artwork series:**
`/canvas-design "urban landscapes" "png"`

## Deduced Conceptual Thread

**Critical step:** Identify the subtle conceptual reference within the art itself - a sophisticated, niche element that enhances depth without announcing itself. Someone familiar with the subject should feel it intuitively, while others experience masterful abstract composition.

**Examples:**
- Jazz influences in geometric compositions
- Architectural references in spatial layouts  
- Literary themes in typographic treatments
- Musical rhythm in visual patterns

Remember: Focus on visual expression through form, space, color, and composition - minimal text, maximum design impact.
